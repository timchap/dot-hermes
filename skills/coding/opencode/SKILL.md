# OpenCode CLI

Use [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) as an autonomous coding worker orchestrated by Hermes terminal/process tools. OpenCode is a provider-agnostic, open-source AI coding agent with a TUI and CLI.

## When to Use

- User explicitly asks to use OpenCode
- You want an external coding agent to implement/refactor/review code
- You need long-running coding sessions with progress checks
- You want parallel task execution in isolated workdirs/worktrees

## Prerequisites

- OpenCode installed: `npm i -g opencode-ai@latest` or `brew install anomalyco/tap/opencode`
- Auth configured: `opencode auth login` or set provider env vars (OPENROUTER_API_KEY, etc.)
- Verify: `opencode auth list` should show at least one provider
- Git repository for code tasks (recommended)
- `pty=true` for interactive TUI sessions

## Binary Resolution (Important)

Shell environments may resolve different OpenCode binaries. If behavior differs between your terminal and Hermes, check:

```
terminal(command="which -a opencode")
terminal(command="opencode --version")
```

If needed, pin an explicit binary path:

```
terminal(command="$HOME/.opencode/bin/opencode run '...'", workdir="~/project", pty=true)
```

## Model Selection (OpenRouter pool)

OpenCode connects to OpenRouter for provider-agnostic model routing. The following pool is pre-selected based on coding capability, reasoning depth, and cost efficiency:

| Tier | When to use | Model | $/1M tokens | Context |
|------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Low** | Typos, docs, config tweaks, trivial fixes, simple shell scripts | `qwen/qwen3.6-35b-a3b` | $0.14/$1.00 | 262K |
| **Low** | Code snippets, boilerplate generation, simple scripts | `meta-llama/llama-4-scout` | $0.10/$0.30 | 10M |
| **Medium** | Feature implementation, multi-file changes, adding tests | `qwen/qwen3-coder-plus` | $0.65/$3.25 | 1M |
| **Medium** | Debugging, API integration, moderately complex logic | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` | $3.00/$15.00 | 1M |
| **High** | Architecture decisions, complex refactors, security review, multi-service systems | `anthropic/claude-opus-4` | $15.00/$75.00 | 200K |
| **High** | Deep reasoning, research-level problems, adversarial debugging | `openai/o4-mini-high` | $1.10/$4.40 | 200K |

**Auto-selection rules** (apply if the user does not specify a model):

1. Scan the user's request: how many files/areas are affected? Is it a localized fix or a systemic change?
2. Classify:
   - **Low** if: single file, no dependency changes, formatting/docs/config/typo, trivial one-liner
   - **Medium** if: 2-5 files, new feature in existing architecture, adds tests, moderate logic, API wiring
   - **High** if: cross-cutting changes, architecture/restructuring, security-sensitive, multi-service, or user says "think carefully" / "complex" / "design"
3. If the user names a specific model, honor it (override auto-selection).
4. Prefer Anthropic sonnet-4 for medium and opus-4 for high -- best coding track record. Use Qwen/Llama for low-cost tasks where quality is not the bottleneck.

**Usage:** pass `--model openrouter/<provider>/<model>` when starting opencode:
```
opencode run 'Add logging to error handler' --model openrouter/qwen/qwen3.6-35b-a3b
opencode run 'Refactor auth module across 4 services' --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4
```

For interactive TUI sessions, the model is set via Ctrl+X M (command palette) or you can pre-select with `--model` before starting.

## One-Shot Tasks

Use `opencode run` for bounded, non-interactive tasks:

```
terminal(command="opencode run 'Add retry logic to API calls and update tests'", workdir="~/project")
```

Attach context files with `-f`:

```
terminal(command="opencode run 'Review this config for security issues' -f config.yaml -f .env.example", workdir="~/project")
```

Show model thinking with `--thinking`:

```
terminal(command="opencode run 'Debug why tests fail in CI' --thinking", workdir="~/project")
```

Force a specific model:

```
terminal(command="opencode run 'Refactor auth module' --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4", workdir="~/project")
```

## Interactive Sessions (Background)

For iterative work requiring multiple exchanges, start the TUI in background:

```
terminal(command="opencode", workdir="~/project", background=true, pty=true)
# Returns session_id

# Send a prompt
process(action="submit", session_id="<id>", data="Implement OAuth refresh flow and add tests")

# Monitor progress
process(action="poll", session_id="<id>")
process(action="log", session_id="<id>")

# Send follow-up input
process(action="submit", session_id="<id>", data="Now add error handling for token expiry")

# Exit cleanly -- Ctrl+C
process(action="write", session_id="<id>", data="\x03")
# Or just kill the process
process(action="kill", session_id="<id>")
```

**Important:** Do NOT use `/exit` -- it is not a valid OpenCode command and will open an agent selector dialog instead. Use Ctrl+C (`\x03`) or `process(action="kill")` to exit.

### TUI Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Submit message (press twice if needed) |
| `Tab` | Switch between agents (build/plan) |
| `Ctrl+P` | Open command palette |
| `Ctrl+X L` | Switch session |
| `Ctrl+X M` | Switch model |
| `Ctrl+X N` | New session |
| `Ctrl+X E` | Open editor |
| `Ctrl+C` | Exit OpenCode |

### Resuming Sessions

After exiting, OpenCode prints a session ID. Resume with:

```
terminal(command="opencode -c", workdir="~/project", background=true, pty=true)  # Continue last session
terminal(command="opencode -s ses_abc123", workdir="~/project", background=true, pty=true)  # Specific session
```

## Common Flags

| Flag | Use |
|------|-----|
| `run 'prompt'` | One-shot execution and exit |
| `--continue` / `-c` | Continue the last OpenCode session |
| `--session <id>` / `-s` | Continue a specific session |
| `--agent <name>` | Choose OpenCode agent (build or plan) |
| `--model provider/model` | Force specific model |
| `--format json` | Machine-readable output/events |
| `--file <path>` / `-f` | Attach file(s) to the message |
| `--thinking` | Show model thinking blocks |
| `--variant <level>` | Reasoning effort (high, max, minimal) |
| `--title <name>` | Name the session |
| `--attach <url>` | Connect to a running opencode server |

## Procedure

1. Verify tool readiness:
   - `terminal(command="opencode --version")`
   - `terminal(command="opencode auth list")`
2. Determine model tier using the Model Selection section above (or honor user's explicit model choice).
3. For bounded tasks, use `opencode run '...' --model openrouter/<tier-model>` (no pty needed).
4. For iterative tasks, start `opencode --model openrouter/<tier-model>` with `background=true, pty=true`.
5. Monitor long tasks with `process(action="poll"|"log")`.
6. If OpenCode asks for input, respond via `process(action="submit", ...)`.
7. Exit with `process(action="write", data="\x03")` or `process(action="kill")`.
8. Summarize file changes, test results, and next steps back to user.

## PR Review Workflow

OpenCode has a built-in PR command:

```
terminal(command="opencode pr 42", workdir="~/project", pty=true)
```

Or review in a temporary clone for isolation:

```
terminal(command="REVIEW=$(mktemp -d) && git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git $REVIEW && cd $REVIEW && opencode run 'Review this PR vs main. Report bugs, security risks, test gaps, and style issues.' -f $(git diff origin/main --name-only | head -20 | tr '\n' ' ')", pty=true)
```

## Parallel Work Pattern

Use separate workdirs/worktrees to avoid collisions:

```
terminal(command="opencode run 'Fix issue #101 and commit'", workdir="/tmp/issue-101", background=true, pty=true)
terminal(command="opencode run 'Add parser regression tests and commit'", workdir="/tmp/issue-102", background=true, pty=true)
process(action="list")
```

## Session & Cost Management

List past sessions:

```
terminal(command="opencode session list")
```

Check token usage and costs:

```
terminal(command="opencode stats")
terminal(command="opencode stats --days 7 --models anthropic/claude-sonnet-4")
```

## Pitfalls

- Interactive `opencode` (TUI) sessions require `pty=true`. The `opencode run` command does NOT need pty.
- `/exit` is NOT a valid command -- it opens an agent selector. Use Ctrl+C to exit the TUI.
- PATH mismatch can select the wrong OpenCode binary/model config.
- If OpenCode appears stuck, inspect logs before killing:
  - `process(action="log", session_id="<id>")`
- Avoid sharing one working directory across parallel OpenCode sessions.
- Enter may need to be pressed twice to submit in the TUI (once to finalize text, once to send).
- The `--model` flag requires the `openrouter/` prefix when using OpenRouter.

## Verification

Smoke test:

```
terminal(command="opencode run 'Respond with exactly: OPENCODE_SMOKE_OK'")
```

Success criteria:
- Output includes `OPENCODE_SMOKE_OK`
- Command exits without provider/model errors
- For code tasks: expected files changed and tests pass

## Rules

1. **User invokes this skill = use OpenCode.** If the user asks you to do something *with* this skill loaded, use OpenCode for the task regardless of scope. Do not bypass it because the task feels "too small" -- the user's explicit invocation is a signal to delegate.
2. If you need to explain why OpenCode isn't suitable (e.g. it's not installed, auth is broken, task is outside a codebase), say so explicitly and ask if the user wants you to proceed anyway or do it directly.
3. Prefer `opencode run` for one-shot automation -- it's simpler and doesn't need pty.
4. Use interactive background mode only when iteration is needed.
5. Always scope OpenCode sessions to a single repo/workdir.
6. For long tasks, provide progress updates from `process` logs.
7. Report concrete outcomes (files changed, tests, remaining risks).
8. Exit interactive sessions with Ctrl+C or kill, never `/exit`.
9. Always auto-select the model tier per the Model Selection section above; never use a default/unspecified model.
